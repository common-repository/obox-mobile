Pronto turns your WordPress website into a fully function mobile plugin.

== Description ==

[Pronto](https://www.oboxthemes.com/pronto/ "One-click mobile website") is a one-click mobile conversion plugin for your WordPress website.

*Update* Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we've made Pronto Pro pay-what-you-want until the end of April.

All you need to do is activate the plugin to turn your site into a fully mobile experience for your users.

Responsive themes are mobile compromised, not optimised. Pronto overrides your heavy desktop theme and instead delivers a clean, lightweight totally mobile optimised experience for your users.

= How does it work? =

Activate the plugin, customize your logo and go! The plugin has no specific setup requirements, it will work out of the box.

= Jetpack Mobile Theme Replacement =

As of March 2020, the Jetpack Mobile theme is being deprecated. Thankfully you can use Pronto as an alternative, meaning you won't have to change your theme!

= Full WooCommerce Support =

Pronto has full WooCommerce support, allowing you to run a full mobile e-commerce website with a design completely optimized for mobile browsing.
